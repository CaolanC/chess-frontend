# How to launch if unfamiliar:

`npm install` to install required node packages.

	I have live-server installed globally for working with frontend.
	You can install it with `sudo npm install -g live-server`

Then it's as simple as `live-server` and it should launch the server on a localhost which is included in live-server's output.
